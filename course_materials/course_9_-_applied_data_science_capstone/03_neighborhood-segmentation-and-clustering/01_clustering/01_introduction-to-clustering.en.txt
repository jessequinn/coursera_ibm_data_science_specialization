Now that you are acquainted with the
Foursquare API you should be ready to start analyzing any neighborhood or city
using location data. However we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them,
and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like
New York or Toronto. To be able to do that, we need to learn how to cluster
data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning. So in the next video,
we will learn about a very popular clustering algorithm, called k-means.
Once you watch the next video and complete the lab on clustering, you
should be ready to start segmenting and clustering neighborhoods in different
cities. So in this module, together we will segment and cluster
neighborhoods in the city of New York. And now I'll leave you with the video on
clustering.
