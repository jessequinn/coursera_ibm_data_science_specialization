00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,100
Now that you are acquainted with the
Foursquare API you should be ready to

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:11,370
start analyzing any neighborhood or city
using location data. However we decided

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,980
to explore neighborhoods, segment them,
and group them into clusters to find

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,020
similar neighborhoods in a big city like
New York or Toronto. To be able to do

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,789
that, we need to learn how to cluster
data which is a form of unsupervised

6
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,260
machine learning. So in the next video,
we will learn about a very popular

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,370
clustering algorithm, called k-means.
Once you watch the next video and

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,300
complete the lab on clustering, you
should be ready to start segmenting and

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,770
clustering neighborhoods in different
cities. So in this module,

10
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,460
together we will segment and cluster
neighborhoods in the city of New York.

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,780
And now I'll leave you with the video on
clustering.
