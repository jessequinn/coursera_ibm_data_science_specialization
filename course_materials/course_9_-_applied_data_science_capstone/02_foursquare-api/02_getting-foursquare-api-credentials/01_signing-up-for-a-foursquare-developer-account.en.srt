00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,220
Before we can learn how to retrieve data
from the Foursquare database, we need to

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,599
create a developer account. Let me walk
you through the process of doing that. So

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:24,090
let's go to Foursquare.com and click on
the Developer tab on the top right

4
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,930
corner of the page.

5
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:34,189
This will take us to the developer page.
Now click on Create Account.

6
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:44,340
Here, we don't have an account yet, so
click on Sign up for Foursquare. Now on

7
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,260
this page, go ahead and fill in your
personal information, and once you're

8
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,489
done hit the Sign up button.

9
00:00:54,230 --> 00:01:01,530
Congratulations! Your developer account
is now created. On May 31st of 2018,

10
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,010
Foursquare updated their API, and unlike
before, now there are some limitations on

11
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,930
how many calls you can make to the API.
So when you create a developer account,

12
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:21,720
the default type is the sandbox account,
with 950 regular calls per day and 50

13
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,970
premium calls per day, and you can
retrieve only one photo and one tip per

14
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,920
venue. I'll explain the different
types of calls in a minute but let's

15
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,990
first go ahead and create a new app so
we can start making calls to the API and

16
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:47,100
retrieving data. Click on create a new
app. Let's name it coursera-capstone-project

17
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:56,610
and give it the URL
www.courseracapstoneproject.com.

18
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,350
Normally, if you're leveraging the Foursquare data in a real app that you're

19
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,630
building, then you would type it here but
since we're not building any app then it

20
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,980
doesn't really matter what URL we use. Once you're done,

21
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:17,379
check the two boxes and click continue.
The next step is to choose your account

22
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:21,610
here, in case you're not very happy with
the features you get with the default

23
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:28,569
sandbox account. Foursquare now has three
developer verified account tiers and you

24
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:33,010
will get to know why I said verified in
a second. There is the personal account

25
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:39,310
which is still free, and with it you get
99,500

26
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:46,750
regular calls and 500 premium
calls. That is actually 100 times more

27
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:52,930
calls than the default sandbox account.
You'll also get access to over 105

28
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:59,019
million venues or points of interest, but
you still only get two photos and two

29
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:03,849
tips per venue, which is just one more
photo and tip compared to the sandbox

30
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:10,750
account. The other two tiers are for
companies and enterprises so they don't

31
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,720
really apply to us. Now if you want to
proceed,

32
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:20,669
choose the personal account and click
continue. The reason why I said

33
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:26,440
verified account in the previous slide
is because to be able to upgrade to the

34
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,060
personal account you will need to
provide your credit card information, but

35
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:36,489
it won't be charged and will only be
used for verification purposes. This step

36
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:40,299
is really optional and you don't have to
fill in your credit card information if

37
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:45,489
you are not comfortable with that, but
just be mindful of how many calls you

38
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:50,049
can make with the sandbox account if you
end up using the API for any personal

39
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:55,180
projects. If you decide to upgrade to a
personal account, fill in your credit

40
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:01,239
card information and click verify. If you
don't wish to upgrade simply click on

41
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:07,780
"Return to My Apps" and that's it. You can
now see the app that you just created

42
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:13,299
and your Foursquare API credentials: your
Client ID and your Client Secret. You

43
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:17,459
will need to pass these credentials
every time you make a call to the API.

44
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:24,010
Now what is a regular call and the
premium call? The Foursquare API is

45
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:29,860
really very well documented
so if you go to Docs, it will take you

46
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:37,240
to the documentation overview page. You can
click on API and then endpoints overview,

47
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,590
and here you will find the different
groups and endpoints available and

48
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:46,810
whether each endpoint falls under a
regular or a premium call. So to search

49
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,850
for coffee shops around you for example,
your call to the API would be considered

50
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,770
a regular call. You would use the search
endpoint to search for coffee shops

51
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:03,639
around you. This is considered a regular
call but learning more about Kaffe 1668

52
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,389
from the previous video, would be
considered a premium call. So you would

53
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:14,470
either use the details endpoint which is
considered a premium call or if you want

54
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:20,740
to get the venue's tips or the hours or
the menu or any links, these are all

55
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,330
considered a premium call. Please
bookmark this page as you will find it

56
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,669
very useful when working with the
Foursquare API. At this point you should

57
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:36,160
be ready to start making calls to the
Foursquare API. In the next video, I will

58
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,300
show you how you can start communicating
with the Foursquare database and making

59
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:46,620
calls to its API to retrieve location
data. I'll see you in the next video.
