00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,970
Welcome to this module of the capstone
project course. In this video, we will

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,570
start learning about Foursquare and how
their data looks like. So let's get

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:15,839
started. As a brief introduction for
those who are still not very clear about

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,820
Foursquare, Foursquare is a technology
company that built a massive dataset of

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,410
location data. What is interesting about
Foursquare is that they were very smart

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,730
about building their dataset. They
actually crowd-sourced their data and had

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,649
people use their app to build their dataset and add venues and complete any

8
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,780
missing information they had in their
dataset. Currently its location data is

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,430
the most comprehensive out there, and
quite accurate that it powers location

10
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,530
data for many popular services like
Apple Maps, Uber, Snapchat, Twitter and

11
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,230
many others, and is currently being used
by over 100,000 developers, and this

12
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:01,440
number is only growing. To try out
Foursquare you can either use their

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,159
phone app or their online website. So you
can go to Foursquare com, and this will

14
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,530
be the landing page. In the centre, you
will find two fields: one for what you're

15
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:21,659
looking for and another one for the
location of interest. So say it's your

16
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,670
first time visiting New York City and
you're saying at the Conrad hotel, but

17
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,020
you're not quite familiar with the area
and you would like to go for coffee. So

18
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,520
what you do is you type words related to
coffee like coffee or coffee shops and

19
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,210
you specify the address around which to
search. In this case, the Conrad Hotel is

20
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:50,399
at 102 North End Avenue in New York and
then you hit search. And here are the

21
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,049
coffee shops that are returned by
Foursquare. On the left you see the name,

22
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,790
the category, and the address of each of
the venues serving coffee around the

23
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,280
Conrad Hotel. And on the right side, you
see a map of the venues in the list on

24
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,640
the left.

25
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:13,480
According to the map, coffee shop number
16 is the closest,

26
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:20,680
and is called Kaffe 1668, and has an
average rating of 9.0. If you click on it

27
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,659
on the map, the list on the left scrolls
to this venue. You can also explore the

28
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:30,810
venue, so if you click on it you will be
redirected to its page on Foursquare.

29
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:37,840
This is the page pertaining to Kaffe 1668
on Foursquare. On this page you can find

30
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,140
all information in the Foursquare dataset about Kaffe 1668. This includes its

31
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:50,110
name, full address, working hours, menu, and tips and images that users have posted

32
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:56,230
about the shop and any of its drinks. You
can check out the tips posted, so if you

33
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:03,489
click the tips tab, it will take you to
the tips section on this page. In this

34
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:09,579
section, you can see how many tips users
submitted about Kaffe 1668. We can see

35
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:15,069
that there are 338 tips and reviews
submitted. The first review is by a user

36
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:22,750
named Jessica and her tip was upvoted
by another user. The review says "Unique

37
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,849
coffee options and hipster baristas to
tell you all about them. Downstairs is

38
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:31,569
usually empty and quiet.
Don't be turned off by the giant fridge

39
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:37,540
in the room, great space for getting work
done." At that point, you might decide to

40
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,590
know more about this user and check
if she had given any other tips or

41
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,120
reviews about other places nearby. So if
you click on her name, you'll be

42
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,190
redirected to her page on Foursquare.
This is the page of Jessica on

43
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:56,829
Foursquare. Here you can see that she is
a very active Foursquare user. She

44
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:04,030
actually posted 269 other tips and
reviews, and has 38 followers, and is

45
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:10,859
following 36 users. On her page you can
also see what places she's been to, and

46
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:19,449
what images or tips she posted about
different places. So you decide to go to

47
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:24,820
Kaffe 1668 for coffee, but you're
interested in knowing what other spots

48
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,470
are popular around the Conrad Hotel so you can go check them out after

49
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,730
you have your coffee. You can again use
the Foursquare website for that. You

50
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,870
simply enter the location of interest
and leave the other field empty.

51
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:43,240
Once you hit Search, Foursquare will
return all the popular spots around the

52
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:49,210
Conrad Hotel. Notice how now the popular places are of different categories. So

53
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,830
there is Central Park which is obviously
a park and there is the Metropolitan

54
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,660
Museum of Art and so on. What is great
about the Foursquare data is that all

55
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,100
this data is available for free so you
can actually build something similar.

56
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,400
Actually, all this data was available for free

57
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,550
without any limitations until May 31st
of 2018. We will learn more about the

58
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:19,900
Foursquare database in the next couple
of videos. In the next videos, I will

59
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,790
demystify the process of communicating
with the Foursquare database and explain

60
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,960
to you what happens under the hood every
time we clicked the search button to

61
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,420
search for coffee shops or learn more
about a shop or a Foursquare user. So

62
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,530
I'll see you in the next video.
