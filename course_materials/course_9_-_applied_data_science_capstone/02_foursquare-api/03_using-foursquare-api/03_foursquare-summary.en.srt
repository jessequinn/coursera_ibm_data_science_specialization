Before we end this module, let's recap
what we can do with the Foursquare API.

2
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:12,360
So using the Foursquare API, we can
search for specific type of venues or

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,300
stores around a given location. And it is
important to remember that for this data,

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,269
we make a regular call to the API, and if
you have a free personal developer

5
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:31,650
account ,you can make up to approximately
99 thousand regular calls per day. We can

6
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,440
also learn more about a specific venue
or store or shop, like their full address,

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,170
their working hours, and their menu if they
have one, and so on. It's also important

8
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,360
to remember that for this data, we would
need to make a premium call and with the

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:55,370
personal developer account, you
can make approximately 500 calls per day.

10
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:01,739
Also with the Foursquare API, we can
learn more about a specific Foursquare

11
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,439
user, their full name, and any tips or
photos that they have posted about

12
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:14,720
venues and stores. For this data, a
regular call to the API would be made.

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,930
Furthermore, we can explore a given
location by finding what popular spots

14
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,900
exist in the vicinity of the location,
and for this data a regular call to the

15
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:37,259
API would be made. And finally, with the
Foursquare API, we can explore trending

16
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,329
venues around a given location. These are venues with the highest foot traffic at

17
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:48,869
the time this regular call to the API is
made. That's it for now. I'll see you in

18
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:51,500
the next video.
