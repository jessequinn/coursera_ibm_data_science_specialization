In this video, we will continue learning
how to use the Foursquare API to retrieve data from the Foursquare
database, and I'll show you how you can use the API to explore a location and to
get trending venues around a point of interest. The last thing we did in the
video when we were exploring Foursquare. com was trying to find the popular
spots around the Conrad Hotel. How do we do that using the API? Well we use the
venues group but we use the explore endpoint instead of the search endpoint,
and we pass the latitude and the longitude coordinates of the Conrad
Hotel along with our credentials. Then we make the call to the database and in
return we get a list of the popular spots around the Conrad Hotel. Just like
with the search endpoint, for each venue we get mostly its name, unique ID,
location, and category. Another cool thing you can do with the Foursquare API is
getting trending venues nearby. These are venues that have the highest
foot traffic when the call to the database is made. Therefore the results
vary depending on when the call is made. So in the morning you might find that
trending venues are coffee shops or office spaces whereas in the evening
trending venues can be malls, museums or parks. And to get the trending venues, you
simply use the trending endpoint along with the credentials and the latitude
and the longitude coordinates of the place of interest. You make the call to
the database and you get a JSON file of the trending venues that are nearby.
In the JSON file, for each trending venue, we get mostly its name, unique ID,
location, and category.
