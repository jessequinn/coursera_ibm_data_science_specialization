00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,339
In this video, we will continue learning
how to use the Foursquare API to

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,210
retrieve data from the Foursquare
database, and I'll show you how you can

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,370
use the API to explore a location and to
get trending venues around a point of

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:20,390
interest. The last thing we did in the
video when we were exploring Foursquare. com

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:25,439
was trying to find the popular
spots around the Conrad Hotel. How do we

6
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:32,279
do that using the API? Well we use the
venues group but we use the explore

7
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,160
endpoint instead of the search endpoint,
and we pass the latitude and the

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,020
longitude coordinates of the Conrad
Hotel along with our credentials. Then we

9
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,090
make the call to the database and in
return we get a list of the popular

10
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,550
spots around the Conrad Hotel. Just like
with the search endpoint, for each venue

11
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:03,059
we get mostly its name, unique ID,
location, and category. Another cool thing

12
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,290
you can do with the Foursquare API is
getting trending venues nearby.

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,250
These are venues that have the highest
foot traffic when the call to the

14
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,530
database is made. Therefore the results
vary depending on when the call is made.

15
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,540
So in the morning you might find that
trending venues are coffee shops or

16
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,119
office spaces whereas in the evening
trending venues can be malls, museums or

17
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,630
parks. And to get the trending venues, you
simply use the trending endpoint along

18
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,650
with the credentials and the latitude
and the longitude coordinates of the

19
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:44,340
place of interest. You make the call to
the database and you get a JSON file of

20
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:51,570
the trending venues that are nearby.
In the JSON file, for each trending venue,

21
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:59,600
we get mostly its name, unique ID,
location, and category.
